TensorFlow is an open-source ML library developed by Google.TensorFlow is used to build and train deep
learning models as it facilitates the creation of computation graphs and efficient execution on various hardware platforms.
The article provides an comprehensive overview of tensorflow.

TensorFlow is basically a software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs where:
* nodes in the graphs represent mathematical operations
* edges in the graph represent the multidimensional data arrays (called tensors) communicated between them.

COMPUTATIONAL GRAPH
Any TensorFlow Core program can be divided into two discrete sections:
Building the computational graph.A computational graph is nothing but a series of TensorFlow operations
arranged into a graph of nodes.
