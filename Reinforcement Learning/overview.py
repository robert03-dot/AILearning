Reinforcement Learning is a branch of machine learning focused on making decisions to maximize cumulative
rewards in a given situation.Unlike supervised learning,which relies on a training dataset with predefined
answers,RL involves learning through experience.In RL,an agent learns to achieve a goal in an uncertain,
potentially complex environment by performing actions and receiving feedback through rewards or penalties.

Key Concepts of Reinforcement Learning
Agent: The learner or decision-maker.
Environment: Everything the agent interacts with.
State: A specific situation in which the agent finds itself.
Action: All possible moves the agent can make.
Reward: Feedback from the environment based on the action taken.
